## Forms

# Box Framework Documentation

## Introduction

The Box Framework is a powerful and flexible tool designed to facilitate the creation of database web interface. It is built around the concept of forms, which are composed of blocks and widgets. These forms serve as the interface for inserting data into a database, making it easier to manage and organize information.

## Key Concepts

### Forms

Forms are the core components of the Box Framework. They act as the entry masks for inserting data into the database. Each form is designed to capture specific types of data and can be customized to fit various use cases.

### Blocks

Blocks are the building units of forms. They group related widgets together, providing a structured way to organize data entry fields. Blocks can be nested within other blocks, allowing for complex form layouts.

### Widgets

Widgets are the individual data entry fields within a form. They can be of various types, such as text fields, dropdown menus, checkboxes, and more. Widgets are responsible for capturing user input.
